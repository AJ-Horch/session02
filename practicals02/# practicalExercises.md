- What pieces of advice from the talk are most persuasive to you?
- To what extent do you agree with Corum's statement that _"the goal of the design process is to find a clear thought and then show it."_?
- To what extent do you agree with Corum's statement that _"visualization is not counting"_ and that it should only _"find and show **meaningful** patterns"_?

- Where do Corum's goals fit into Boom's taxonomies described above?

- “Good design is clear thinking made visible.” This sounds obvious but thats not always the case. Furthermore the need to sketch out ideas and iterate over designs were the most persuasive.

- I fully agree with the statment.

- I don't fully agree with what Corum had to say here. Sometimes visualization really is just counting, trying to understand the data your working with. His example of dog breeds was well thoughtout but just because there is no discrenable pattern doesn't make the viz useless. If the viewer couldn't tell a retirver from a lab and that poster cleared up the distinctions for them, wasn't it affective.
- Corum's goals are between ananlyze and understand. As he said he doesn't always understand what he's reading or viewing. And being that he is publishing this work for a wide audience, I don't think he's trying to create or motivate change, but instead attempting to distill dense knowledge to a vast readership.

Is this a data visualization? What elements of it embrace _data humanism_ and _feminist data visualization_?

{|task)}

From a humanism stand point Weber is gathering small, everyday data. Trivals of life if you will. She's also removed the computer from the process. As for Feminist data viz, I don't know? What's feminist about a scraf? Is it feminist because a woman made it? Train delays effect people equally - or do they. Perhaps a woman would face harsher conquences for being late to work than her male collegues.

Can the approach represented by Lupi and Posavec in _Dear Data_ be reconciled with Corum's assertion that "visualization is not counting"? Apart from the subject matter how does personal visualization differ from other forms of data visualization?

{|task)}

{(annotation|}

As stated I don't agree with Corum's assertion that vis is not counting. It is - it might not be the most elegant form of viz it still counts. Dear Data blends quantive and qualiative personal data in a unique way. For instance I thought the example of them counting interactions with their partners was gorgeous, even if they were just counting how many times they said 'i love you' or were annoyed. There's a saying I picked up from some habit self-help book that I think applies here: 'What gets measured, gets managed'. People are hard wired to see patterns, thus visualizing our data is important to recognize our surroundings/interactions/rountines etc.

Identify the "data ink" and "non-data ink" in the graphics above. Would you consider any of it "chart junk" ? Why do you think some data visualizations include chart-junk?

{|task)}

{(annotation|}

A lot of junk here. Data ink is side bar chart and the outter rings of the circle. Everything else is junk. I think most data vizs include junk in order to make the infographic more appealing, more eye catching.
